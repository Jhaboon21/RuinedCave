Made in Unreal Engine 4.

The Ruined Cave is a game about a treasure hunter that is trying to get rich quickly. He
has had bad luck recently and has explored several ruins with no treasure. Fortunately, he
received a tip that this ruin is newly discovered and should have some good loot inside.
Gameplay should last about 5 minutes. There will be traps, puzzles, and enemies to avoid. The
level will exist underground and have pitfalls and traps. There will be areas where the player
must jump across large holes using a grapple gun as a swing. The layout will have some
maze-like elements but be mostly straightforward. The goal is to get in and explore the ruin to
find the valuable treasure at the end and escape with it. When the player collects the treasure
the ruin will begin to collapse which will change the layout of the ruins slightly. This will make the
player look for an alternate route to the exit. Other than falling into the pits/spike traps, there
isnâ€™t any fall damage but touching traps or enemies will hurt or kill the player. Enemies would
consist of ghosts or skeletons. The player will have a health bar and a few extra lives. There will
be a few checkpoints that the player will respawn from when their health reaches zero. The
player will lose if health and remaining lives reach zero.
